**Other questions/thoughts**

[^jurisdictional]: Suburban has agreed upon a price with Amerigas for WCA hardware. When a propane storage tank serves ten or more metered units in a single building the State of Vermont requires additional piping tests. If you want to go deeper into these weeds, look [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ehax1i53i5yc10j/JurisdictionalPropane.pdf?dl=0). Five Woodhaven buildings are jurisdictional (2, 5, 6, 7, 9). Suburban has offered to put in 500 gallon tanks and separate 4 metered units in each of the buildings--at no cost to WCA--to avoid the jurisdiction requirements. This is not a condition of their proposal, but their preference. Eastern suggested ignoring the jurisdictional issue.

[^selkirk]: Selkirk, NY is the terminal end of the [TEPPCO pipeline](../images/_NEPropaneSupplyLocations.png) that begins at Mont Belvieau, TX. The wholesale price at Selkirk is a benchmark price for NY and NE. Typically suppliers refer to profe$\$ional publication\$ for the published price. [People's Energy Group](https://peoplesenergygroup.com/fuel-pricing/) posts a free and pretty good estimate.
  
Steps to transfer accounts (Who, what, when, how.)

Sample customer invoice?

Peter D. to review contract? (Lots of boilerplate and hold harmless.) Probably no chance of changing it.

Service dept.

Supply dept...run outs? Customer service.
